While this project is mainly maintained by \href{https://github.com/AeroStun}{\texttt{ @\+Aero\+Stun}}, external contributions are more than welcome.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{What to contribute}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md1}
lib\+SMCE is still in its early life, so bugfixes, new features, support for more platforms, user and developer documentation, as well as more tests, are all good ways to contribute to SMCE.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Who can contribute}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md2}

Start by looking at the \href{https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE/issues}{\texttt{ issues page}}, either to get ideas on what to do, or check whether someone else is already working on your idea.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{1. Check discussions}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md5}
Next, look at the \href{https://github.com/ItJustWorksTM/libSMCE/discussions/categories/ideas}{\texttt{ ideas category in the discussions page}}. There you can see if someone has already proposed your idea and what feedback they got. If nobody ever suggested that idea of yours, open a thread, and tell us everything about it! We will happily give you feedback regarding the usefulness and feasibility of your idea, as well as tips for getting started on it.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{2. Fork the repo}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md6}
This is to avoid cluttering the upstream lib\+SMCE repository with user branches. It also allows you to experiment with different automation services.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{2.\+x Enable Git\+Hub Actions}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md7}
Would not want to miss a test failure caused by your patch, would you?\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{3. Work on your own feature branches}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md8}
i.\+e., do not work on {\ttfamily master} or {\ttfamily devel}, else you might have trouble updating your fork when upstream gets new commits.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{4. Open a draft $<$a href=\char`\"{}https\+://github.\+com/\+It\+Just\+Works\+TM/lib\+SMCE/pulls\char`\"{} $>$\+Pull Request$<$/a$>$ against $<$tt$>$devel$<$/tt$>$ on upstream}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md9}
This is so everyone can easily follow your progress, and for you to ask us questions while citing your changes on our CI runs of your PR.\hypertarget{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{5. Request a review from @\+Aero\+Stun}\label{md__c_o_n_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_n_g_autotoc_md10}
Once your PR is passing CI and you are satisfied with your patches, requesting a review from the maintainer will get you another look at your changes, and point out visible issues. ~\newline
